# Personal Resume Website

This repository contains my personal resume website, built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and GitHub Pages. This project also serves as a template and teaching resource for a web development workshop within my fraternity to help members build and deploy their own personal resume websites.

## Overview

This website includes:

- Landing page (`index.html`)
- About page (`about.html`)
- Experience page (`experience.html`)

The site is designed to provide a clean, professional overview of my background, experience, and career interests. It also serves as a beginner-friendly template that others can copy, customize, and deploy as their own personal website.

## Technologies Used

- HTML  
- Tailwind CSS (via CDN)  
- Git

## Seminar & Educational Purpose

This project was created as part of a web development workshop for members of my fraternity. The goal of the seminar is to help participants:

- Build and deploy their own personal resume website  
- Learn how websites are structured and hosted  
- Understand how to use GitHub for version control and deployment  
- Gain exposure to real-world development tools and workflows  
- Create a professional asset they can include on resumes, LinkedIn, and job applications  

Rather than focusing on teaching programming at an advanced level, the workshop focuses on teaching the workflow, tools, and structure needed to create and maintain a personal website.

This repository serves as a template that participants can fork, modify with their own information, and deploy as their own live website.

---

## Deployment

The site is deployed using GitHub Pages directly from the `main` branch.

Any updates pushed to the repository automatically update the live site.

This allows for simple deployment without needing servers or paid hosting.

1. Fork or clone this repository  
2. Replace the existing content with their own information  
3. Push their changes to GitHub  
4. Enable GitHub Pages  
5. Instantly have a live personal website
